           <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
           <p>VIVA <br>
           <a href="http://www.viva.com.bo" target="_blank">viva.com.bo</a></p>
           <img src="images/viva1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Viva's website" class="image">
           <p>In the website of VIVA we can see how all the visual elements are aligned to something else, showing order, with a good appearance. The logo is horizontal aligned to the purple stripe that holds the menu button. The content is centered in the mobile version of the website. We notice how the icons with options to access are aligned vertically and horizontally. In the mobile option these icons are aligned in two vertical columns, but in the desktop version these icons have a horizontal alignment. The same with other sections in the home page that we can’t see in the screenshot: images of smartphones, and a second group of icons.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
            <p>PLATZI <br>
            <a href="http://www.platzi.com" target="_blank">platzi.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/platzi1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Platzi's website" class="image">
            <p>In the image above of the website of Platzi, we can identify three messages. The first one is displayed with a bigger font. The text of the other messages is compounded by two variations of fonts, in size and color. How we know the blue numbers are related to the white text below them? By the principle of proximity. We can notice how those parts are related one to another because how near they are, and for the white space that separate them from other elements which give them an appearance of block.</p>

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>FAMILYSEARCH <br>
            <a href="http://www.familysearch.org" target="_blank">familysearch.org</a></p>
            <img src="images/familysearch1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Familysearch's website" class="image">
            <p>Because the way the content is displayed in the homepage of FamilySearch.org, we have a clear idea what information is more relevant, and what things we must to pay attention in first place. That is the principle of visual hierarchy. In this example we notice how the size of the main message grabs our attention to introduce us the purpose of the website, then, the color and size of the button calls us to act. Another content shows us the services it offers, and some options to the user that could be less important for a first view.</p>
